Wayland
________________________________________________________________________________

Wayland [0] is a display protocol that aims to be a simpler and more modern
replacement for the X Window System. The Wayland protocol follows a
clientâ€“server model in which clients are the graphical applications requesting
the display of pixel buffers on the screen, and the server (compositor) is the
service provider controlling the display of these buffers.

Unlike how Xorg is the center of the universe (which everyone must talk to),
Wayland puts the Linux kernel and its components (DRI, DRM, etc) in the middle.
This effectively leaves the Wayland compositor off in the corner as little more
than a special application [1].

Wayland has been in development since September of 2008 and is usable today for
a large number of use-cases. Some hardware configurations (namely NVIDIA GPUs)
[2] [3] are poorly supported. However, Wayland is seeing increased adoption in
much larger projects, including GNOME [4] and KDE [5]. There is also work to
make Firefox run on Wayland-only systems [6], and Chromium can already be fully
built without Xorg libraries using Ozone [7]. If all you need is a web browser,
a terminal, and dmenu, Wayland can work quite well for you.

[0.0] Getting Started
________________________________________________________________________________

Because Wayland is not officially supported, all Wayland packages must be
managed by the users themselves. However, most of the software required for
Wayland and most compositors can be found in the main repositories, and Wayland
support can be added by simply modifying the build scripts. 

Several user repositories already exist which provide Wayland packages. 

* For a repository which supports Xwayland with sway and firefox, check out
  $/Himmalerin/kiss-wayland

* For a repository that opts for a strictly xorgless approach and uses hikari
  and chromium, look at $/dilyn-corner/KISS-me


    [0.1] Caveats
    ____________________________________________________________________________
    
    While the Wayland protocol is more or less done, the compositors available
    can differ in protocol implementation. Xorg is still in wide use and 
    alternatives to usual software must be sought. Luckily, many Xorg analogues
    already exist for Wayland - see [2.1].
    
    The major downside to Wayland is the reduction in choice. While the Wayland
    protocol does not define what a compositor shall depend on, they can
    potentially require udev, PAM, and elogind. Additionally, Xorg has nearly an
    unlimited number of window managers and desktop environments to select from.
    With Wayland, there are far fewer compositors to choose.
    
    wlroots provides a standard that many Wayland compositors choose to 
    implement, and most software can be expected to work across most wlroots
    compositors. For those which don't utilize wlroots, however, finding
    software which works can be trickier.
    
    In short, the general limitations users can expect are as follows:
    
    - Limited NVIDIA support [8]
    - Nonstandard and compositor specific software [9]
    - No Wayland support in SDL 1 (must use XWayland) [10]
    - Starting compositors without logind requires SUID permissions [11]
    
    
    [0.2] Benefits
    ____________________________________________________________________________
    
    Wayland has a useful number of benefits and improvements over Xorg. The 
    above caveats do not apply to everyone (or every system). Those unaffected
    or willing to live with the caveats will have no problem swapping over.
    
    - Fewer moving parts - libraries are provided by 2-3 packages instead of 20+
    - Fewer packages to maintain
    - Better multimonitor and HiDPI support [12]
    - No screen tearing [14]
    - Hardware accelerated video playback in Firefox and Webkit2GTK [15]
    
    
    [0.3] Prerequisites
    ____________________________________________________________________________
    
    If Xorg is required for specific applications like firefox or games, many
    Xlibs are still required and xorg-server must be built with xwayland
    support. If Xorg is not needed, then libxkbcommon and xkeyboard-config are
    the only xorg packages required for wayland and wayland-protocols.
    
    Many packages can identify if Wayland support is to be built without user
    intervention. Some packages which will require extra work include:

[1.0] Using Xwayland
________________________________________________________________________________

In general, these steps can be followed on a system already running with Xorg.
Only a few package rebuilds are required to enable Wayland support.

Mesa must be rebuilt first, adding wayland to the list of platforms. 

After that, rebuild libxkbcommon and xorg-server with xwayland support enabled. 

Finally, rebuild all programs which required mesa and xorg-server. Use
kiss-revdepends for a convenient list.

Applications which use Qt and GTK will require you to specify the proper backend
to use. GTK will default to running applications with Wayland. Qt applications
will require you to specify xkb or Wayland for the backend, and supports a
precedent-based list. Additionally, Qt applications will require qt5-wayland.

See [16] for information on other backends and applications.

Add the following to your env (eg $HOME/.profile)

+----------------+-------------------------------------------------------------+
| GTK            | GDK_BACKEND=x11                                             |
| Qt             | QT_QPA_PLATFORM=xcb,wayland                                 |
+----------------+-------------------------------------------------------------+


[2.0] Xorgless
________________________________________________________________________________

Ensure no Xorg packages are installed, and remove any Xorg repositories from
$KISS_PATH, keeping only xkeyboard-config and libxkbcommon. You will have to
modify the depends files of many packages (including mesa, freetype-harfbuzz,
pango, cairo, etc.) to not include any Xorg dependencies, but few modifications
are required beyond that.

First, build wayland and wayland-protocols.

Then, build xkeyboard-config, followed by libxkbcommon with wayland support and
without x11 support.

Finally, build mesa with the wayland platform and without the x11 platform.

Some packages might assume that, because you are building Linux, you must be
using GLX. GLX is a graphics implementation provided by mesa, but is only built
on Xorg systems. Wayland uses EGL and GLES. For some packages, like cairo, you
might have to specify the gl-backend to be used. 

Launching applications in Wayland requires a little more intervention. GTK will
default to Wayland usually, but adding the following to your environment is a
good idea

+----------------+-------------------------------------------------------------+
| GTK            | GDK_BACKEND=wayland                                         |
| Qt             | QT_QPA_PLATFORM=wayland                                     |
| firefox        | MOZ_ENABLE_WAYLAND=wayland                                  |
+----------------+-------------------------------------------------------------+

[3.0] Post installation
________________________________________________________________________________

In environments without seatd/systemd/elogind/consolekit the XDG_RUNTIME_DIR
variable must be set manually. This should be set before trying to launch a
wayland session. Add something like this to your user's $HOME/.profile:

+------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
|                                                                              |
|   mkdir -pm 0700 "${XDG_RUNTIME_DIR:=/tmp/$(id -u)-runtime-dir}"             |
|   export XDG_RUNTIME_DIR                                                     |
|                                                                              |
+------------------------------------------------------------------------------+

Install a compositor. Below is a list:

+----------+-------------------------------------------------------------------+
| dwl      |  A dwm-like compositor using wlroots [32]                         |
| river    |  A compositor inspired by dwm and bspwm using wlroots [33]        |
| sway     |  A tiling compositor similar to i3 using wlroots [34]             |
| hikari   |  A freeBSD window manager inspired by cwm using wlroots [35]      |
| wayfire  |  A 3D compositor inspired by compiz using wlroots [36]            |
| wio      |  A Wayland compositor replicating Plan 9's rio using wlroots [37] |
| velox    |  A dwm inspired compositor using wld and swc [38]                 |
+----------+-------------------------------------------------------------------+

Note that velox does not use wlroots [39]. As a result, certain Wayland
applications might not work as expected. A suggested terminal is a rewrite of st
[40] for Wayland, along with a dmenu [41] reimplimentation.

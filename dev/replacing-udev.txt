REPLACING UDEV
________________________________________________________________________________

As of the 20/01/2020, it is now possible to replace eudev with libudev-zero and
the device manager of your choosing. This Wiki page will cover replacing eudev
with busybox mdev, however the steps are more or less the same for all other
device managers (smdev, vdev, ...).


BENEFITS
________________________________________________________________________________

- Use any device manager, swap between them or use none at all.
- Alternatives are simpler and lighter.
- Faster boot process.


PURGING EUDEV
________________________________________________________________________________

* Disable the udevd service

  # unlink /var/service/udevd


* Remove the eudev package

  The removal is forced as the packages which depend on eudev will be rebuilt.

  $ KISS_FORCE=1 kiss r eudev


* Generate a list of all packages which need to be rebuilt

  $ kiss-revdepends eudev
  libinput/depends:eudev
  xorg-server/depends:eudev


* Build libudev-zero

  $ kiss b libudev-zero && kiss i libudev-zero


* Rebuild all required packages

  NOTE: Some packages may have a mandatory dependency on eudev. You may receive
        errors when attempting to rebuild them. Simply re-install eudev until
        you are able to investigate further.

  NOTE: If the package manager pulls in eudev as part of the rebuild process,
        the package you are trying to rebuild has a mandatory dependency on
        eudev (and you cannot continue this exercise).

  $ kiss b libinput xorg-server


* Verify that the eudev dependence is gone

  The following command should output nothing. If it does not, the outputted
  packages require a rebuild.

  $ kiss-revdepends eudev


CHANGING DEVICE MANAGERS
________________________________________________________________________________

* busybox mdev

  Simply enable the `mdev` service.

  # ln -s /etc/sv/mdev/ /var/service


* uevent helper (Alternate method)

  Modify your KISS hook to install the uevent helper with libudev-zero:

  +--------------------------------------------------------------------------+
  |                                                                          |
  |   case $TYPE in                                                          |
  |       post-build)                                                        |
  |           case "$PKG" in                                                 |
  |               libudev-zero)                                              |
  |                   "${CC:-cc}" contrib/helper.c -o helper                 |
  |                   install -Dm755 helper "$DEST/usr/bin/uevent-helper"    |
  |               ;;                                                         |
  |           esac                                                           |
  |                                                                          |
  +--------------------------------------------------------------------------+

  Enable CONFIG_UEVENT_HELPER in your kernel configuration and set
  CONFIG_UEVENT_HELPER_PATH to /usr/bin/uevent-helper.

  Alternatively, the uevent helper path can be set by the init system.

  # echo "/bin/echo /usr/bin/uevent-helper &ltdir&gt > /proc/sys/kernel/hotplug"
  #     > /etc/rc.d/uevent-helper.boot

  Replace &ltdir&gt with the path where you want the uevent files to be stored, or
  leave it empty to use the default path.


* Other device managers

  Open an issue in $/kiss-community/init as the init scripts will need support
  for other device managers.


REBOOT
________________________________________________________________________________

If all went well, you should now be using mdev as your device manager while
retaining a fully working graphical environment with hotplugging functionality.
If input doesn't work under Xorg, refer to the Xorg log file for information.
